    # The `owm bundle register` command actually registers the bundle. This puts a reference
    # to the descriptor file in the .owm directory
    owm bundle register bundle.yml

    # `owm bundle list` lists the bundles registered in this owmeta project
    owm bundle list
    # Output:
    # http://example.org/yep#abundle - This is a bundle used for demonstration purposes

    # If you move or rename a bundle file owmeta will not know about it: it does not track
    # file moves. It will, however, tell you if a bundle descriptor cannot be found when you
    # list registered bundles.
    mv bundle.yml aBundle.yml

    #
    owm bundle list
    # Output:
    # http://example.org/yep#abundle - ERROR: Cannot read bundle descriptor at 'bundle.yml'

    # To correct this, you must re-register the bundle at the new location
    owm register aBundle.yml

    # If you're done with a bundle, you deregister it. You can provide either the descriptor
    # file name or the bundle name

# [FETCH]
fetch() {
    # [BASIC] showed us how to create and list bundles, but what about when you want
    # someone else's bundles? To fetch a bundle, you need the bundle name. That name is
    # queried for in your local repository (see below in [LOCAL]), then in any remotes
    # configured in your ".owm" directory or user settings, and finally the default remote
    # (see [REMOTE]). `owm bundle fetch` does this for you.
    owm bundle fetch example/bundle.00

    # Fetching a bundle puts it in your local repository so you can use it in any projects on
    # the local machine. You use a bundle in Python with the Bundle object. You can access
    # contexts within a bundle by passing the context to the bundle as shown below.
    use_a_bundle 'example/bundle.01' \
        'https://openworm.org/data#example_bundle_context'

    # Note that the bundle does not need to have been already fetched. use_a_bundle.py, we use
    # a bundle example/bundle.01 which we had not previously
    # fetched. When you make the Bundle object, owmeta will retrieve the bundle from remotes
    # if necessary.
}

# [LOCAL]
local() {
    # The local index keeps track of all of the bundles currently cached on the system from
    # remotes and installed locally. The owmeta.bundle.Bundle class uses the local index to
    # find bundles. The local cache is a directory tree containing bundle contents (i.e.,
    # contexts and associated files).
    #
    # The index is kept up-to-date by various `owm` commands and it is not intended that it be
    # modified by other tools or manually. The index should also not be deleted carelessly --
    # this would render the local cache mostly useless.
    #
    # The files in the local cache are either fetched from remotes or come from bundles
    # installed locally. Bundles may be installed and listed in the index without their files
    # being in the local cache -- this is to allow for keeping data files in an existing
    # directory structure on the local machine. Like with the index, cached files should only
    # be handled through the `owm` commands.
    #
    # To query for bundles in the local index use the `owm bundle index query` command.
    owm bundle index query
    # Output:
    # example/bundle.00 - An example bundle
    # example/bundle.01 - Another example bundle

    # To remove a bundle from the index:
    owm bundle index remove example/bundle.00

    # This will not remove from the cache, however. To remove un-indexed files in the cache,
    # use `owm bundle cache gc`
    owm bundle cache gc
}
# [REMOTE]
# Remotes are places where bundles come from when they aren't in the local cache and where
# bundles go to be shared. The default remote is a maintained by OpenWorm.
#
# TODO: Define a default remote.
# TODO: Define commands for working with remotes
remote () {
}

# [INSTALL]
install() {
    # As stated in [LOCAL], bundles can be installed to the local index. We can install a
    # bundle in our project like this:
